When it finishes, mencoder is used to create a movie. Options inclde a prowl alert and a google drive uploader.  \r\n\r\nMake sure you update the directory paths in all the scripts.\r\n\r\n**sunsetcheduler.py**\r\nThis is a python script which will calculate the next sunset time and schedule an at job to start the timelapse one hour before sunset and until 1 hour after sunset.  \r\n\r\nYou may need to _'apt-get install at'_ if you don't have it already.\r\nI uses anacron to schedule a daily job which will fire off the sunsetscheduler once a day. \r\napt-get install anacron' \r\n\r\n**time.sh **\r\nthis is a oneliner which launches the actual timelapse.sh script\r\n\r\n**timelapse.sh**\r\nTHis script is the one which does all the work. THere's a few directory variables to set. It accepts two arguments - the first is the number of hours to run, and the second is the snapshot interval.  So, running _'sh timelapse.sh 2 5'_ will run for two hours snapping a pic every 5 seconds.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the run, mencoder is called and crunches all the pictures into a video, and deletes the jpgs.  WARNING: mencoder was tricky to get installed on the latest raspbian on my pi3.  \r\n\r\n",
